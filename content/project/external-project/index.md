title: Unified Lightweight Encryption IP for Resource-Constrained Scenarios
summary: Electronic control units (ECU) have been widely used in modern resource-constrained automotive systems, communicating through the controller area network (CAN) bus. However, they are still facing man-in-the-middle attacks in CAN bus due to the absence of a more effective authentication/encryption mechanism. To defend against the attacks more effectively, we propose a unified lightweight authenticated encryption that integrates recent prevalent cryptography standardization ISAP and ASCON.Experimental results show that our proposed unified lightweight authenticated encryption can reduce 26.09$\%$ area consumption on Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA board compared with the state-of-the-arts.
